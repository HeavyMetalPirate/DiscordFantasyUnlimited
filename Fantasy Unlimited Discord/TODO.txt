- Battle:
	- Tweak formulas in BattleParticipant.class - at least partially done TODO !!!
	- Tweak damage formula in BattleAction.class - at least partially done TODO !!!

	- Create abstract class CannotUseDuringBattleCommandHandler which checks if you are in a battle, and if so, denies your command

- Consumables
